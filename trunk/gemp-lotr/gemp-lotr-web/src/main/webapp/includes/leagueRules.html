            <li><b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> consists of multiple <b style="color:#009f9f">League series</b>
                (number - to be announced).
            </li>
            <li>Each <b style="color:#009f9f">League serie</b> lasts a fixed amount of days (to be announced).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Participation:
        <ol type="a">
            <li><b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> starts at an announced date and lasts until specified number of <b
                    style="color:#009f9f">League series</b> are
                played out.
            </li>
            <li>Player joining a <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> during a first serie is given a specified for that
                <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> amount
                and type of virtual product (boosters and fixed cards).
            </li>
            <li>At the beginning of each subsequent serie, each player participating in the <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b>
                is given the
                same amount and type of virtual product (boosters and/or fixed cards).
            </li>
            <li>Player who chooses to join a league after the first serie, is given a product that is a sum of all the
                virtual product he/she would have been given if he joined during a first serie up until the point in
                time he/she has chosen to join. This product WILL NOT contain any prizes given to participants of the
                <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b>.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Deck building:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Each player builds a deck from the virtual product he/she owns within that <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b>.
            </li>
            <li>Deck in a <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> can be changed at any time. When you create or join a
                table with a deck, that
                deck is set at that point and any changes done to the deck afterwards, will not be reflected in the game
                on that table. If you wish to use a different deck for that game before it starts, leave and rejoin a
                table after modifying your deck.
            </li>
            <li>Virtual cards given out as prizes for that <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> are LEGAL for playing in
                the <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b>.
            </li>
            <li>There is no limitation to the number of multiples of the same card (with the same card name) you can
                play in your deck, except sites. If you happen to have 10 copies of a card in your <b
                        style="color:#009f9f">League</b>
                product, you can play all 10 of them. If more than 4 non-unique copies of the same card are in play, all
                of them influence the game (this contradicts the rules, where maximum 4 copies of the same card can be
                active at a time).
            </li>
            <li><b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> has no X or R lists, so all cards are legal.</li>
