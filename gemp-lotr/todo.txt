
- add links to the users list to their profiles
- add email column to user
- add email field to register form
- create auth attempt database
- create email authentication process
	- generates temporary code, stores in auth attempt database along with creation time
	- sends email to that requested address with code and link to email auth api
	- email auth api accepts email, user, and code
	- upon triggering within an acceptable time frame, auth flag is set on user's entry
- add user account page
	- show current email with auth/not auth image
	- "enter code" button which calls email auth api
	- "resend email" button which regenerates auth attempt entry (does not invalidate older entries)
	- has user setting: "email me with Gemp news" which is opt-in.
	- "reset my password" button with are-you-sure prompt
		- if email is authorized, sends 
	- hall settings 
		- foil presentation (animated|static)
		- auto-accept
		- always display drop-down
		- Phase auto-skip array
	- manage user ignore list
	- 
- create password reset process
	- if email is authenticated, email is sent to address with a link to password reset API
	
	
	
- Upon log-in, checks to see if an email is associated with an account. If not, produce a pop-up that bugs the user to go to the user page and authenticate an address
- Add "forgot my password" link
	- if email is authenticated, sends email to address with password reset link
	- if email is not authenticated, posts a link to Discord and instructions to contact the moderation team
		- asks user to describe the names and contents of their decks
		- approving reset prompts user to change password and email upon attempting login
		
		
		
		
Strategy:
	- add email field + email auth dbs
	- add account settings page
		- and maybe public profile page just to sweeten the deal
	- add password reset
	- require all new accounts to register email before playing
	- bug existing users to register email with a month's warning
	- after a month or so, require all existing users to register email before playing
